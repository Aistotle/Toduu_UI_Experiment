# Batch Execution Guide

This folder contains phase-based task batches for structured implementation.

---

## Phase Order

Execute phases sequentially:

```
Phase 0 (Foundation)
    ↓
Phase 1 (Core Implementation)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Polish & Hardening)
    ↓
Phase X (Overflow / Discovered)

Tests → Run after corresponding implementation batches
```

---

## Naming Convention

Batch files follow: `P{phase}-{letter}-{description}.md`

| Component | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `PX` | Phase number | `P1` = Phase 1 |
| `A-Z` | Batch sequence within phase | `A` = first batch |
| `description` | Kebab-case task name | `schema-parity` |

**Full example:** `P1-A-schema-parity.md` = Phase 1, Batch A, Schema Parity

## How to Execute a Batch

1. **Read the phase README** — Understand scope boundaries
2. **Read the batch file** — Get specific tasks and file paths
3. **Complete all tasks** — Each checkbox is one unit of work
4. **Run verification** — `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`
5. **Mark progress** — Check off tasks in the batch file with `[x]`

---

## Between Phases

Before starting a new phase:

- [ ] All batches in previous phase complete
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes
- [ ] `pnpm test` passes
- [ ] Phase exit criteria met (see phase README)

---

## Rules

### DO

- Read batch file completely before starting
- Complete all tasks before moving to next batch
- Run tests after each batch
- Reference what_and_why.md (Part 2) for decisions
- Mark tasks complete with `[x]` as you go

### DO NOT

- Skip phases or execute out of order
- Modify files outside batch scope
- Make decisions not in the plan
- Leave tasks partially complete

---

## Progress Tracking

Each batch file uses checkboxes:

```markdown
- [ ] **P0-1**: Pending task
- [x] **P0-2**: Completed task
```

Phase progress is tracked in the phase README.
