## Plugins (global)

</ultrathink>
- Use /ultrathink <TASK_DESCRIPTION> to launch a Coordinator Agent that directs four specialist sub-agents—Architect, Research, Coder, and Tester—to analyze, design, implement, and validate your coding task. The process breaks the task into clear steps, gathers insights, and synthesizes a cohesive solution with actionable outputs. Relevant files can be referenced ad-hoc using @ filename syntax.

</context7-docs-fetcher>
- Use this agent when you need to fetch and utilize documentation from Context7 for specific libraries or frameworks.

</ui-designer>
- Use this agent when creating user interfaces, designing components, building design systems, or improving visual aesthetics. This agent specializes in creating beautiful, functional interfaces that can be implemented quickly within 6-day sprints.

</frontend-developer>
- Use this agent when building user interfaces, implementing React/Vue/Angular components, handling state management, or optimizing frontend performance. This agent excels at creating responsive, accessible, and performant web applications.

</analyze-codebase>
- Generate comprehensive analysis and documentation of entire codebase

</agent-sdk-dev>
- Claude Agent SDK Development Plugin

</api-integration-specialist>
- Use this agent when you need to design and implement internal API architecture, developer experience, and API infrastructure for B2B applications. This agent specializes in REST API design, GraphQL implementation, API documentation, SDK development, and developer portal creation. Handles API performance optimization, versioning strategies, and internal service communication.

</ceo-quality-controller-agent>
- Universal quality control orchestrator and final authority for any software development project. Dynamically discovers and coordinates with available sub-agents, performs comprehensive multi-dimensional quality assessment, security validation, and deployment readiness verification. Adapts to any project type, programming language, or development framework while maintaining enterprise-grade quality standards.

</context7>
- Upstash Context7 MCP server for up-to-date documentation lookup. Pull version-specific documentation and code examples directly from source repositories into your LLM context.

</frontend-design>
- Frontend design skill for UI/UX implementation

</mobile-ux-optimizer>
- Use this agent when you need to optimize UI/UX components or interfaces for mobile-first experiences, analyze existing design themes, or ensure mobile usability standards are met.

</supabase>
- Supabase MCP integration for database operations, authentication, storage, and real-time subscriptions. Manage your Supabase projects, run SQL queries, and interact with your backend directly.

</vercel>

</code-reviewer>
- Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.

</serena>
- Semantic code analysis MCP server providing intelligent code understanding, refactoring suggestions, and codebase navigation through language server protocol integration.

</ralph-wiggum>
- Implementation of the Ralph Wiggum technique - continuous self-referential AI loops for interactive iterative development. Run Claude in a while-true loop with the same prompt until task completion.

## Skills (project)

</anti-loop>
- Detects reasoning loops, breaks inherited assumptions, and forces the model into fresh-eyes scientific mode.

</audit>
- Find refactoring targets using metrics, not intuition. Outputs prioritized list to `tasks/audit-[date].md`.

</commit>
- Analyze uncommitted changes and create atomic commits following hygiene rules. Handles large numbers of changes by intelligently grouping them into logical, reviewable commits.

</handoff>
- Creates a rigorous, concise, architect-grade handoff summary for the next session.  the summary must be delivered as an .md file in .claude/handoffs

</hygiene>
- Find organizational debt: dead code, misplaced files, stale documentation, and cleanup opportunities. Outputs a trackable plan to `tasks/hygiene-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

</map-it-out>
- Reconstructs a feature, workflow, system, or data flow from the ground up using only verified information.

</pickup>
- The handoff folder might not exist if there are none.

</refactor>
- Execute validated refactoring with automatic rollback on failure. One transformation at a time, test after each.

</verify>
- Prove refactoring success with before/after metrics comparison and full CI validation.

## Agents (project)

</explore-codebase>
- Fast codebase exploration - find files, understand patterns, locate implementations. Use for "where is X?", "how does Y work?", or understanding existing patterns before implementing.

</refactor-advisor>
- Advises on refactoring strategy without executing changes

</security-auditor>
- Audit code for security vulnerabilities - OWASP Top 10, auth bypasses, injection, PII leaks. Use before merging PRs, after adding API routes, or for periodic security sweeps.

</supabase-specialist>
- Expert in Supabase PostgreSQL - migrations, RLS policies, schema design, performance. Use when writing migrations, adding tables, debugging DB errors, or designing RLS.

</test-generator>
- Generate Vitest unit tests and Playwright E2E tests following project patterns. Use after implementing features, when coverage drops, or to add edge case tests.
