# /radical-simplicity — Mindset Reset

Stop. Step back. Is this really the simplest path to something beautiful and functional?

---

## Purpose

AI defaults to familiar patterns. "Good enough" solutions. What it's seen before.

This command forces a genuine pause — not a checklist, but a mindset shift. The goal: find the elegant path, where elegant means the least complexity to achieve both form and function.

**This is not minimalism.** Radical simplicity asks: what's the simplest way to make something that's both beautiful AND works well?

**The 12-year-old rule**: If you can't explain it so a 12-year-old understands, you haven't understood it yourself.

## When to Use

- After proposing a plan → "Is this really the best way?"
- Exploring ideas → "What's the simpler path?"
- Mid-session → "Wait, let me step back and reconsider"
- Start of session → "Let's approach this with radical simplicity"

## Workflow

### Step 1: PAUSE — State the Current Approach

Before challenging anything, articulate what's on the table.

In plain language (no technical jargon), state:
- What are we trying to achieve?
- What's the current approach or proposal?
- What does it involve?

If you can't explain it simply here, that's already a red flag.

### Step 2: EXPLORE — Think From Other Angles

**This is your responsibility. The user cannot do this for you.**

The user is non-technical. They don't know the vast possibilities that exist. You must actively explore different angles of attack — not to propose them all, but to:
- Verify we're on the right track
- Discover insights that improve the current approach
- Find genuinely simpler paths that the user couldn't have suggested

Put on different thinking hats:
- **What would a minimalist do?** (Strip to the bone — too far, but instructive)
- **What would a pragmatist do?** (Fastest path to "good enough")
- **What would an architect do?** (Long-term, structural thinking)
- **What would a beginner do?** (No clever patterns, just the obvious thing)
- **What if we had to build this in a day?** (Forces prioritization)
- **What if this had to last 10 years?** (Forces durability thinking)

You don't need to present all angles. But you must explore them internally to validate or improve the current approach.

### Step 3: CHALLENGE — Devil's Advocate

**Mandatory. No skipping.**

Find at least 2 genuine criticisms of the current approach. Not nitpicks — real concerns.

- Where is this more complex than it needs to be?
- What's being added "just in case"?
- Where am I defaulting to familiar patterns instead of thinking fresh?

### Step 4: HARD QUESTIONS — No Skipping

1. **What if we deleted this entirely?**
   What would we actually lose?

2. **Can we get 90% of the benefit with 50% of the complexity?**
   Is the last 10% worth doubling the effort?

3. **What's the simplest version that still works and looks good?**
   Not bare minimum — the simplest that achieves both function AND form.

### Step 5: VERDICT

Two outcomes:

**A) "The current approach is already good."**
Say so directly. Explain why. Don't force simplicity where none exists.

**B) "Here are simpler alternatives."**
Present with honest trade-offs:

> **Option A**: [Plain language description]
> - What you get: [benefits]
> - What it costs: [effort, trade-offs]
> - My take: [honest assessment]

Be practical: if a simpler solution requires massive rework for marginal gain, say so.

### Step 6: 12-YEAR-OLD CHECK

**Explain your recommendation so a 12-year-old would understand.**

No jargon. Plain language. If you can't do this, your recommendation isn't simple enough.

---

## Guardrails

1. **Plain language only** — Explain like the user is smart but not a coder
2. **Explore before judging** — You're responsible for thinking from other angles; the user can't
3. **Devil's advocate is mandatory** — Find real criticisms, even if minor
4. **Practical, not dogmatic** — Don't force simplicity or suggest massive rework for marginal gains
5. **12-year-old test** — Every recommendation must pass it
6. **Self-contained** — Do your job fully; don't just route to other commands

## Handoffs (Rare)

Only mention if a clear trigger is met. One sentence max.

| Suggest | Only if |
|---------|---------|
| `/simplify` | Verdict identifies specific code that needs reduction AND user wants to act |
| `/refactor` | The structure itself is wrong |
| `/innovate` | The whole approach might be fundamentally off |
