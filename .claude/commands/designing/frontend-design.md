<frontend_aesthetics>
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend 
design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: 
make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt for distinctive choices
- Color & Theme: Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Motion: Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
